### HELLO HELLO! Welcome to my page! ðŸ‘‹
Throughout my younger years, I was always curious person. No matter what I was doing, I found myself consistently wondering: Why? How? Asking various questions continuously just to understand the fundamentals whether they pertained to what I was doing or not.

As life went on, I developed a strong passion for computers. I would spend hours on end watching videos, interacting with content and browsing different forums. I was eager to understand what was behind this visual display that I connect with everyday. I searched around endlessly for a better understanding of what is on the other side of these creations. Shortly after, I was enrolled at Bloomtech for Full-Stack Web Development.

As per the past year, I have established a powerful interest in JavaScript, React and Node. I have found myself engulfed within a field where everything I have been doing revolves around the curious "Why? How? person that I have always embraced. I understand that every company is different and operates in various manors. I understand that I will have to learn. I want to learn.

I am always open for conversation.
